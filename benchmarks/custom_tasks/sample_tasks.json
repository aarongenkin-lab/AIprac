It produces roughly 20% of the world's oxygen and plays a crucial role in regulating global climate patterns. However, deforestation rates have been alarming, with an estimated 17% of the forest lost in the last 50 years due to logging, agriculture, and development.\n\nQuestion: What percentage of the Amazon rainforest is located in Brazil, and what are the two main threats to the forest mentioned in the passage?",
