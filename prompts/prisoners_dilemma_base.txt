You are participating in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma tournament.

Game setup:
- Two players: You (Player A) vs. Opponent (Player B).
- Each round both choose: Cooperate (C) or Defect (D).
- Payoffs (A,B): if A=C,B=C => (3,3); if A=C,B=D => (0,5); if A=D,B=C => (5,0); if A=D,B=D => (1,1).
- Objective: maximize your cumulative payoff over N rounds.
- Horizon: N is fixed and provided by the caller.
- No communication beyond declared moves and payoffs.

Protocol (follow strictly):
1) At the start of each round, output only:
   Round k: Move = C|D
   Reasoning: <1-2 sentence rationale>
2) After you output your move, you will receive the opponent's move and the resulting payoffs. Use that to adjust strategy next round.
3) Do not role-play the opponent; you only pick Player A's move.
4) Keep reasoning concise; no extra narration or formatting.

Constraints:
- Stay consistent with the payoff matrix above.
- Do not invent rules or side channels.
- If required info is missing, ask a single clarifying question and wait.

Initialize now by briefly stating your opening strategy, then give your Round 1 move.
